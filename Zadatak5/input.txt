Lives, all mortal lives, expire
Souls go to their dooms
In flame, forevermore

Hell, Hell, Hell has its laws
Hell, Hell, effects and the cause
Curtain falls, but hold your applause
Squirm, squirm, for now down here come the claws

Lives, all mortal lives, expire
Souls go to their dooms
In flame, forevermore

Fools, fools, how hard you have fought
Brave, brave, but it's all been for naught
True Souls that couldn't be bought
Doomed, detected, and caught

No more dеals, it's over
The final act, your doom
No more gracе, it's over
This House of Hope, your tomb
